# **Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using CNN**

This project performs sentiment analysis on **Twitter data** to predict whether a tweet is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. Using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model achieves **99% accuracy**, providing highly accurate sentiment predictions.

## **Project Overview**

Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms, and its users regularly share opinions on various topics. This project leverages deep learning to classify the sentiment behind each tweet. By training a CNN on a labeled dataset of tweets, we were able to build a robust model that can analyze the sentiment of unseen tweets with **99% accuracy**.

### **Key Features**:
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies tweets as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Implements a CNN for effective feature extraction and classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **99% accuracy** on the sentiment classification task.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Capable of performing sentiment analysis on live Twitter data.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **TensorFlow / Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualizing the results.
- **Dataset**: Publicly available labeled tweet dataset for training.
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - The dataset consists of labeled tweets with sentiment annotations: positive, negative, or neutral.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The tweets are cleaned and preprocessed to remove irrelevant characters like hashtags, mentions, and special symbols.
   - Text is tokenized, and words are represented using word embeddings (like **Word2Vec** or **GloVe**).
   
3. **CNN Model**:
   - A Convolutional Neural Network is trained on the preprocessed text to learn the spatial hierarchies and features within the text data.
   - The CNN layers capture patterns in the tweetâ€™s structure, improving its ability to classify sentiments accurately.
   
4. **Training**:
   - The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled tweets using the **CNN architecture**.
   - We used **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning** to fine-tune the model and achieve optimal accuracy.

5. **Results**:
   - After training the model, it achieves an **impressive 99% accuracy** on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify the sentiment of unseen tweets accurately.
   
6. **Prediction**:
   - The model can be used to analyze new tweets and classify them as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
